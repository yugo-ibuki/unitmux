# unitmux

Unifies your AI coding sessions into a single floating interface.

[日本語版はこちら](README.ja.md)

## What it does

unitmux is a small always-on-top window that connects to all your AI coding assistants (`claude`, `codex`) running in tmux. Send commands, see status, and pick choices — all from one place, without switching terminals.



## Requirements

- macOS
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) with at least one session running `claude` or `codex`

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install --cask yugo-ibuki/tap/unitmux
```

### Manual

Download the latest DMG from the [Releases](https://github.com/yugo-ibuki/unitmux/releases) page and drag the app to `/Applications`.

### macOS Gatekeeper warning

On first launch, macOS may block the app because it is not notarized. To open it:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security** → scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to the blocked message.

## How to use

1. Start `claude` or `codex` inside a tmux pane
2. Open unitmux — it automatically finds your AI panes
3. Select a pane from the tags at the top
4. Type your message and press `Cmd+Enter` to send (configurable to `Enter` in settings)

### Pane badges

Each pane tag shows a badge indicating which tool is running: **CC** (Claude Code) in blue, **CX** (Codex) in green.

### Status indicators

| Indicator  | Meaning                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Green dot  | Ready for input                                   |
| Orange dot | Busy, processing                                  |
| Gray dot   | Waiting for your response — choice buttons appear |

### When the AI asks a question

When `claude` or `codex` presents numbered choices (e.g. "1. Yes / 2. No"), clickable buttons appear next to the pane tag. Click one to respond instantly.

Popups support vim-style navigation: `j`/`k` (scroll), `d`/`u` (half-page), `g`/`G` (top/bottom), `q` (close).

The pane preview (`Ctrl+P`) opens scrolled to the bottom and highlights Claude's last response with a blue accent border. Press `Ctrl+P` again to start **live streaming** — the preview updates every 500ms in real time, with a pulsing LIVE badge. You can also toggle streaming with the ▶/⏸ button in the popup header. During streaming, `j`/`k` scrolling pauses auto-scroll; press `G` to resume following the latest output.

### Session detail

Press `Ctrl+D` to view details of the selected pane: target, command, model, session ID, PID, CWD, and git branch/status. The detail panel also has a **Close Session** button to terminate the pane. Pressing `Ctrl+C` while the detail panel is open shows a confirmation dialog before closing.

### Session management

Press `Ctrl+N` to create a new session. A dialog lets you pick a target tmux session and choose whether to launch `claude` or `codex`. The new window is created in the selected tmux session and the pane list refreshes automatically.

### Git operations

Press `Ctrl+G` to open git operations for the selected pane's working directory. You can **Add All**, **Commit** (with a message), and **Push** directly from the popup. Shortcuts within the popup: `Ctrl+A` (add all), `Ctrl+P` (push).

### Slash commands

Save reusable text snippets as slash commands (e.g., `/fix`, `/review`). Type `/` at the start of the textarea to see a filterable autocomplete list. Select a command with `Enter`, `Tab`, or click to insert its body. Manage commands in the **Slash Commands** section of the sidebar.
